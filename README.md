# swimming-whale
A simple JavaScript animation of a swimming whale! See a demo of it <a href="http://susieboyland.com/swimmingwhale/" target="_blank">here.</a>
<br><br>Upon page load, the whale image moves across the page from left to right in a sinusoidal motion. The image can be easy replaced with any other image (as long as it's small enough to fit on the page and have room to move) to create a custom animation for your webpage.
<br>
<br>The image used in this animation is from <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/168920/baleine" target="_blank">openclipart.org
